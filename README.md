Pneumonia Detection using Machine Learning
==========================================

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia using machine learning models applied to medical imaging data. The goal is to leverage data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training techniques to achieve accurate and reliable predictions. Developed as part of an academic evaluation, this project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to a real-world healthcare problem.

Objectives:
- Build a reliable machine learning model for pneumonia detection.
- Apply preprocessing techniques to handle imaging data.
- Utilize feature extraction and selection to improve model performance.
- Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics for medical diagnosis.

Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, normalization, and preparation of imaging data.
- Feature Engineering: Implements techniques to extract meaningful features from the dataset.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Trains machine learning models and evaluates performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Reproducibility: Contains a well-documented notebook to ensure all steps can be reproduced.

Workflow:
1. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, resizing images, and normalizing pixel values.
2. Feature Extraction: Extract key features using image processing techniques.
3. Model Training: Train machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or CNN) on the extracted features.
4. Evaluation: Measure model performance using cross-validation and medical diagnosis metrics.

Results:
- Achieved high accuracy in pneumonia detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
- Model performance metrics confirm robustness and suitability for medical imaging applications.
